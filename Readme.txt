1st Project: BUILD A WEBSITE
Guideline: https://www.tutorialworks.com/devops-project-ideas/

Suggested steps

    Create a Git repository to store your work
    Create (provision) a virtual machine (VirtualBox, Vagrant, etc.)
    Research and choose a web server and install it on the virtual machine
    Configure the web server to serve a static website (e.g. some basic HTML)
    Make sure you can access the website in your web browser

Remember, you’ll need to use automation. No point-and-click allowed! 🚫
